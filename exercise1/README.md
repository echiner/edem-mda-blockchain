# Exercise 1: Setting up an Ethereum wallet

In this exercise we will be creating an Ethereum wallet which will be running in your browser. With it you will be able to manage it, sign transactions, send and recieve ether, manage tokens, etc.

NOTE: For obvious reasons, in this exercise we will be using an Ethereum testnet [Rinkeby](https://www.rinkeby.io) and not the mainnet.

## Instructions

We will be using [**MetaMask**](https://metamask.io/) to create a Wallet and connect to Ethereum blockchain:

* **Pre-requisite**: Google Chrome or Firefox installed
* Go to MetaMask site: https://metamask.io/download.html
* Install the Chrome extension
* Create a new wallet by clicking on the MetaMask icon (a fox on the top right hand of your browser)
  * You will be asked to note down some words. There are your recovery words in case you lose your wallet.
* Select the “Rinkeby” network (top right)
* Follow the steps in “Rinkeby’s faucet” in order to get some Ether:

  * **TIP**: If you don’t have Twitter or Facebook, feel free to ask the teacher for some Ether
* Send some Ether to your colleagues!!!
